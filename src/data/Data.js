    "aboutDesc": "Working as a Project Manager in an ERP Development industry, triggered my pas- sion in web development. As a new commer in Canada, I had a chance to reshuffle my career, I had no other thoughts than upgrading my skills in Enterprise web and mobile application development. Therefore, I chose to study Enterprise web and mobile application development at Trios College. One of my greatest passion is to enhance my knowledge on new technologies to help building interesting applications to better serve users. I've been fortunate to work on two large Enterprise Resource planning solutions, and one of them were rewarded as the best ERP in Bangladesh and appreciated as one of the greatest innovations to develop insurance industry digitally by the Government of Bangla- desh. While being a student at Trios College, I nurtured my skills in many ways, learning many stacks, skills, and languages to build e-commerce web site.",
